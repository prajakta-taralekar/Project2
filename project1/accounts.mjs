/**
API to maintain bank accounts.  The API data model includes the
following entities:

  Account Holder: External to this API.  Simply represented by an
  externally generated opaque holderId ID.

  Account: Identified by an ID (generated within this API).  Will
  track its holder using the holderId ID.  It will also contain a
  collection of transactions.

  Transaction: Contains

     { id, amount, date, memo } 

  where id is the transaction ID (generated within this API), amount
  is a Number giving the amount of the transaction (>= 0 for deposits,
  < 0 for withdrawals), date is a YYYY-MM-DD String giving the date
  of the transaction and memo is a String describing the transaction.

  Note that the API uses the word 'act' to refer to a transaction.

Our data model makes the following simplifying assumptions:

  + Each account has only a single holder; i.e. there are no
    "joint accounts."

  + Each account has an infinite overdraft; i.e. the balance can
    be negative without limit.

The params argument to API methods is an object specifying values for
the method parameters.  Note that the value of all parameters must be
String's.

Since most API methods operate on an individual account, the `params`
object usually contains an `id` property identifying the relevant
account.

All API methods return errors by returning an object having an errors
property specifying a list of error objects.  Each error is a object

  { message, options? } 

where message is a String specifying the error message and optional
options is an object.  In particular, options can specify property
'code' which is a String giving an error code.

Less verbosely, errors are returned as an object:

  { errors: [ { message: String, options?: { code?: String, ...} } ] } 

where { } indicates an object, [ ] indicates a list/array and ?
indicates optional.

The API documentation specifies errors by code.
